# Trivy Ignore File
# This file lists vulnerabilities that are intentionally ignored with justification

# CVE-2025-64756 - glob Command Injection
# Location: npm's internal dependencies (bundled with Node.js)
# Severity: HIGH
# Reason for ignoring:
#   - This vulnerability is in npm's build tooling, not application runtime code
#   - The vulnerable glob package is used by npm for file operations during install/build
#   - In containerized environments, the attack surface is minimal (no untrusted user input to npm)
#   - This will be fixed when Node.js updates their bundled npm version
#   - Our application code doesn't directly use or depend on this package
# Risk acceptance: Low risk in production container environment
# Review date: 2025-12-27
# Next review: When Node.js 20 updates npm to include glob >= 10.5.0
